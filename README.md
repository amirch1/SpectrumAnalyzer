# Spectrum Analyzer
Video spectrum analyzer using video colors capture

#Description
The video spectrum analyser uses [HTML5 audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) to analyze the video sound track.
It also uses the [Color Thief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief/) library to analyze the video frame colors and uses these colors to render the
analyser bars using canvas gradients. Check out the demo below to see it in action.
